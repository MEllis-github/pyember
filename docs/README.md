# Contributing to Docs

## Getting Started 

0. Assumes you have:
* A local clone of Ember.
* Python >= 3.12 (Materials for MkDocs requirement).

1. Within your choice of virtual environment,
```
pip install mkdocs-material
```

2. Render a local view of the docs (you will need this to PR content later),
```
# From the ember source directory,
cd docs/
mkdocs serve
```

3. To add/edit content, find the corresponding files under `ember/docs/docs`. To make asthetic changes, edit `mkdocs.yml`.

4. For further guidance, see the official Materials for MkDocs [docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) .
